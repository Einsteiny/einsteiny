# Codepath Group Project - *Einsteiny*  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Einsteiny/einsteiny.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Einsteiny/einsteiny)

**Einsteiny** builds on the Khan Academy API & content (for now, could be extended to several content providers) to offer users a way to get daily reminders to take a break and learn something new.  For the busy full time worker or for someone who has challenges sticking to online & remote learning, this tool will help create bite-sized lessons that you can complete to finish an overall goal.

## User Stories

Core:
* [x] User can create an account if none exists or login if already registered

* [x] User can "subscribe" to a course to add it to their current courses or save for later
* [x] User gets notifications of what their next lesson is and when they click on it they are taken to that lesson
* [x] User can see what courses they are in, what they have saved, what they have completed
* [x] Spinner for progress/network load to give proper user feedback
