# Codepath Group Project - *Einsteiny*  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Einsteiny/einsteiny.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Einsteiny/einsteiny)

**Einsteiny** So many apps exist to help us track & measure fitness, water consumption, and nutrition.  With Einsteiny we are trying to bring this style of daily guidance to online learning.
              
Our app helps you sign up for courses from a wide range of categories and for each class you register in, you receive a daily notification with a small (<10min) lesson that will move you through to completing the course.  This helps you learn something new every day and make sustainable steps towards remaining a lifelong learner.
              
If you work full time and want to level up your skills in a new area of study or if youâ€™re someone who wants to learn online but has difficulty staying on goal - we want to help you succeed!
