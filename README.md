# Codepath Group Project - *Einsteiny*

**Einsteiny** builds on the Khan Academy API & content (for now, could be extended to several content providers) to offer users a way to get daily reminders to take a break and learn something new.  Khan does not currently offer a way to get daily reminders to learn a little every day - we hope we can encourage people to form this habit through our interface. 

Time spent: **1** hour spent in total
